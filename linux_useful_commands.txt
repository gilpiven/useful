## Backup & restore ##
#Backup your whole Linux system and how to restore it back if something bad happens to it.

#The command to backup:

sudo rsync -aAXv --delete --exclude=/dev/* --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/sys/* --exclude=/tmp/* --exclude=/run/* --exclude=/mnt/* --exclude=/media/* --exclude="swapfile" --exclude="lost+found" --exclude=".cache" --exclude="Downloads" --exclude=".VirtualBoxVMs" --exclude=".ecryptfs" /source /destination

#**You can also add the option --dry-run to simulate the backup process.



#Restoring the system:

1. Boot from live linux ISO.
2. Mount the backup/USB drive.

mkdir /mnt/system /mnt/usb

3. Check the name of the devices.

lsblk

4. Mount the usb and the system drives. Change these accordingly to your drives.

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/system
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

5. Restore the backup.

sudo rsync -aAXv --delete --exclude="lost+found" /backup /system

6. Restore the swap file.

#To see more options run:

rsync --help
